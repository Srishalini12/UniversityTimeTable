# UniversityTimeTable
The timetable is necessary tool for the efficient working of a university. It is really a mirror that reflects the entire educational programme of the university.university. It is really a mirror that reflects the entire educational programme of the university. Timetable concern all activities with regards to producing a schedule that must be subjective to different constraints’ college timetable is a temporal arrangement of a set of lectures and classrooms in which all the given constraints are satisfied. This paper introduces a framework for a highly constrained school timetabling problem, which was modelled from the requirements of various Finnish school levels. We present a success-full algorithm to solve real-world problems as well as artificial test problems. Moreover, we find the best configuration for this algorithm using brute force and statistical analyses. Finally, we pro-pose a set of benchmark problems that we hope the researchers of the timetabling problems would adopt.




Class timetable: Timetable generation usually helps in preventing the wastage of time for the student in the search of their classes and teachers. It shows the distribution of subjects in each class along with teachers for each period. it also indicates the breaks in between the teaching period along with recess.
Teacher’s timetable: Timetable generation for teachers is also much important in which it ensures equitable distribution of work among teachers.
The timetable is needed to be scheduled in such a way that the number of different courses with a number of subjects in each, handled by a limited faculty provided with their slots and timings does not overlap.
